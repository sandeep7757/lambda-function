This lambda code identify the stale EBS snapshots based on specified retention period

we import the boto3 library to interact with AWS services, specifically the EC2 service for EBS snapshots.

We specify the retention_days variable to set the maximum age for EBS snapshots. Adjust this value as per your organization's retention policy.

We calculate the retention_date by subtracting the retention_days from the current date.

We use the describe_snapshots method to list all snapshots owned by the AWS account. This function retrieves information about your snapshots, including their creation time and ID.

We iterate through the list of snapshots and check if each snapshot's creation time is earlier than the retention_date. If so, we consider it a stale snapshot and log its information.

After identifying a stale snapshot based on the retention policy, we add the ec2.delete_snapshot() method to delete the stale snapshot.

We log a message indicating the deletion of the stale snapshot to keep a record of actions taken.

Be cautious when using this code, it will permanently delete the snapshots when you use ec2.delete_snapshot


Note:

Make sure that the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to describe and delete snapshots.
